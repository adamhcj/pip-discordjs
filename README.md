# pip-discordjs
<p>Node application running discord bot</p>
<p>Built using https://discord.js.org/</p>
<p>"discord.js is a powerful Node.js module that allows you to interact with the Discord API very easily. It takes a much more object-oriented approach than most other JS Discord libraries, making your bot's code significantly tidier and easier to comprehend."</p>

## ðŸ“¹ Preview (Please turn on sounds to hear the bot speak)

<br>
<p>used Google Text-to-Speech for NodeJS https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-gtts</p>
<p>Allows bot to speak in a channel, good for people who have muted mics / shy / in a library</p>

## If you want to keep it running on a server; personally I have hosted it on the cloud in an AWS EC2 instance (t2.micro Amazon Linux 2)

### getting the node files in EC2
Personally I installed git and authenticated github in my EC2 instance

### install external dependencies (if node does not already install)
get ffmpeg: https://gist.github.com/willmasters/382fe6caba44a4345a3de95d98d3aae5
<br>
yum install opus
<br>
*The above may not be necessary as it was only needed for my old discord.py script rather than the current discord.js script.
<br>
<br>
### make new terminal window with tmux (so that this terminal continues even when closing ssh connection):
sudo yum install tmux
<br>
tmux new -s mywindow

### view back the terminal window on the next session:
tmux a -t mywindow
